# Flower
Welcome

This project offers a visually engaging experience that takes users through a day and night cycle. At the centre of the project is a flower that gradually unfolds, revealing its petals. This opening process serves as the focal point of the garden, drawing attention to its transformation.
Key features:

•	Day and night cycle: During the day, the garden is illuminated by sunlight, while the night introduces the moon's glow, creating a serene space.
•	Fireflies: As darkness falls, fireflies appear, illuminating the surroundings and the flower. Their presence adds an enchanting element to the scene.
•	Other animations: The project incorporates the movement of clouds, sun, and moon.
Interactions
